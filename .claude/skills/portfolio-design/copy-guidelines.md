## Section-Specific Guidelines

### Hero Section

**Goal:** Immediate clarity on who you are and what you do

**Structure:**
1. Name + primary role
2. Three current focuses (varied: company, research, shipping)
3. Soft CTA (approachable, not desperate)

**Example:**
```
Nicanor Korir
CTO & Co-Founder at Alma | AI/Robotics Engineer

Currently: Building trauma-informed AI at Alma
Researching: Vision-Language-Action models for robotics
Shipping: Eneza + micro-SaaS experiments

[Grab coffee in Berlin] [Available for consulting]
```

**Avoid:**
- Long bios in hero section
- List of every skill
- Overly humble ("aspiring engineer")
- Overly bold ("world's best")

---

### About Section

**Goal:** Tell your story in a way that builds credibility and connection

**Structure:**
1. What you build (problem + solution)
2. Your journey (Nairobi → Berlin, trajectory)
3. What drives you (the "why")
4. What you're doing now

**Key Elements:**
- Start with impact/results
- Include geographic journey naturally
- Mention specific numbers/metrics
- End with forward-looking statement

**Example Opening:**
```
I architect AI systems that solve real problems — from helping survivors
of gender-based violence navigate complex support systems in Germany
(addressing an €8-11 billion annual productivity loss), to enabling
farmers to detect crop diseases through computer vision.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Leads with impact
- Specific problem domains
- Concrete numbers
- Shows range (GBV to agriculture)

---

### Work Section (Products)

**Goal:** Show what you've built, emphasizing outcomes

**Formula for Each Project:**

```
[Project Name] - [One-line tagline]

Description: [What it does] + [Who it helps] + [How it works]

Impact: [Measurable outcome] + [Scale indicator]

Tech: [Stack, focus on distinctive choices]

Status: [Live | In Development | Prototype]
```

**Example:**
```
Alma - Giving voice to survivors through trauma-informed AI

Multi-agent AI system providing 24/7 multilingual support, emotional
validation, and legal guidance for gender-based violence survivors.
Architecting RAG pipelines, LLM orchestration, and GDPR-compliant
infrastructure addressing an €8-11 billion annual productivity loss
in Germany.

Impact: Addressing €8-11B annual loss | Supporting 3 languages
Tech: Python, FastAPI, AWS Lambda, RAG, LLM Orchestration, GDPR
Status: In Development
```

**Key Principles:**
- Problem → Solution → Impact
- Real numbers (not "significant impact")
- Technical depth without jargon overload
- Status transparency

---

### Work Section (Experience)

**Goal:** Show how you've delivered value at scale

**Formula for Each Role:**

```
[Company] - [Position]
[Dates] | [Location]

[Brief context on what you built/led]

→ [Specific outcome with metric]
→ [Another outcome with metric]
→ [Third outcome with metric]

Tech: [Relevant stack]
```

**Writing Impact Bullets:**

**Bad:**
- "Worked on energy platform"
- "Helped improve efficiency"
- "Developed various features"

**Good:**
- "Architected modular energy platform — 20% reduction in power consumption"
- "Built cloud logistics microservices — 15% infrastructure cost savings"
- "Designed UI component library — 8 hours weekly coding time saved"

**Rules for Impact Statements:**
1. Start with strong verb (Architected, Built, Designed)
2. Include what you built (platform, system, solution)
3. Add quantifiable outcome (%, $, time)
4. Keep under 25 words

---

### Research Section

**Goal:** Show academic rigor + practical application

**Balance to Strike:**
- Technical enough for researchers
- Accessible enough for recruiters
- Practical enough for investors

**Example:**
```
Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation

Bridging the perception-action gap: Researching how VLA models can enable
robots to understand natural language commands and translate them into
precise physical manipulations.

Focus Areas:
• End-to-end learning for pick-and-place tasks
• Multi-modal fusion (vision + language + proprioception)
• Sim-to-real transfer for manipulation
• Real-world deployment challenges

Tools: PyTorch, ROS2, Gazebo, OpenAI CLIP
Status: MSc Dissertation (2025-2026)
```

**Key Elements:**
- High-level concept first
- Then technical details
- Real-world application angle
- Clear scope/status

---

### Contact Section

**Goal:** Make it easy and inviting to reach out

**Tone:** Friendly professional, no barriers

**Example:**
```
Let's Build Something

I'm always open to interesting conversations — whether it's grabbing
coffee in Berlin, exploring consulting opportunities, or discussing
the future of AI and robotics.

[Grab Coffee in Berlin] [Consulting Inquiries]

Or reach out directly:
→ nicanor@email.com
→ LinkedIn: /in/nicanorkorir
```

**Avoid:**
- "Feel free to reach out" (unnecessary permission)
- "Don't hesitate" (negative framing)
- Long lists of what not to contact about
- Overly formal language

---
